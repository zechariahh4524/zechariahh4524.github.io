Hi it's zechariah and it is time for my blog i'm going to be talking about this problem i got on my mid-term for AP CSP the question asked you to design a function that takes in the color of a circle and produces a small dot with the given color the answer was #dot::string->image because you need a string to change the color then a image to make the circle an answer like #dot::number->image wopuld be wrong because it not going to give you what you want
